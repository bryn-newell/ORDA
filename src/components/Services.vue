			<h2>Why Are We Unique?</h2>
			<h3>Experience</h3>
			<p>Collectively our consultants have over 155 years of proven experience working with a variety of industries.</p>
			<h3>Data Gathering Expertise</h3>
			<p>We work with clients to measure the variables they want to measure and collect data electronically through iGPS™. A distinguishing difference between iGPS™ and other surveys is the immediate availability of the results. Rather than requiring clients to wait four weeks to four months to get results, our clients have detailed, actionable information available within 12 seconds after closure of the assessment. iGPS™ further provides intuitive reports (including responses to open-ended questions). Clients are able to manipulate – “slice & dice” – the data on their desktop with no additional charges or waiting for adhoc reports to be developed and forwarded.</p>
			<h3>Bottom-line Results</h3>
			<p>We focus on cultural, attitudinal, financial, and customer satisfaction results and have a proven track record of success in each of these areas. Examples include helping clients increase profits through decreasing unwanted employee turnover, increasing job involvement, increasing collaboration among all levels of employees, and become “Best of Class” organizations.</p>
			<h3>Client Empowerment</h3>
			<p>Whereas most data collection companies limit their services to the collection and analysis of data, we help clients resolve the problems that surface in the diagnosis and gain the skills to become independent of outside assistance.</p>
			<h3>Long-term Results</h3>
			<p>We focus on the accurate diagnosis and the permanent resolution of problems. For example, we have empirical results to support the long-term impact of team building interventions from over 1,400 teams in more than 100 organizations.</p>
			<h3>Emphasis on Accountability</h3>
			<p>Most leaders understand the need for accountability but lack the tools to hold their people accountable in ways that motivate and inspire them to achieve their potential. We provide our clients with proven mechanisms for increasing accountability, simultaneously, developing rock-solid leadership skills.</p>
			<h3>Core Values</h3>
			<p>ORDA maintains the highest level of professionalism and confidentiality. Our core values include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Integrity</li>
				<li>Creativity</li>
				<li>Compassion</li>
				<li>Excellence</li>
				<li>Exceeding Expectations</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Consultation Process</h2>
			<p>We use the action research model, a problem-solving model that is data-based and designed to replicate the scientific method of inquiry. Simply stated, the specific steps or interventions in the action research model include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Collecting data from individuals and groups within the organization.</li>
				<li>Reporting the data to organizational personnel.</li>
				<li>Diagnosing the problems.</li>
				<li>Action planning.</li>
				<li>Reporting the diagnosis and action plan to the client system.</li>
				<li>Implementing activities designed to facilitate change and resolve problems within the system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once these interventions have been completed, additional data are collected and fed back to the client, further problems are diagnosed, and additional interventions are planned. Action research is based on valid information and designed to provide immediate feedback to the client on the status of problems within the system. It is important to understand that each phase of action research constitutes a set of definite interventions in the organization.</p>
			<h3>Case Study: Trucking Industry</h3>
			<p>This model has proven effective, when applied to the driver shortage problems within the trucking industry. Data were collected from fleets of truck drivers over a several-day period through the use of mobile phone surveys. The survey itself required less than 5 minutes to complete, and the use of the mobile phone survey gave drivers flexibility in providing feedback to their leaders. Participation rates were consistently high, and the drivers were very willing to share their insights and attitudes. This highly targeted data collection process allows us to predict truck driver turnover with over 90% accuracy.</p>
			<p>Our system also provides advanced insights and tools to help determine the reasons these drivers intend to leave their jobs. Successful action planning and implementation can significantly reduce turnover and allow fleets to keep the drivers they already have. The cost of replacing and training a new truck driver is estimated at between $8,000 and $15,000, depending on the type of fleet. Given these levels of replacement costs, it is easy to see how valuable it would be to have in place the resources to help retain current drivers.</p>
